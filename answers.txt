Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows us to track changes to our code over time, collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work, revert to previous versions if something breaks, and maintain multiple versions of a project through branching. It's essential for version control in software development.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to healthcare. For example, machine learning models can analyze medical imaging data to detect diseases like cancer earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines two branches by creating a new "merge commit" that ties together the histories of both branches. Rebasing replays the commits from one branch onto another, resulting in a linear history without an extra merge commit. Rebasing creates a cleaner history but rewrites commit history.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to learning data science techniques, working with real datasets, and gaining practical skills in data analysis and visualization that I can apply to intershps and research.
